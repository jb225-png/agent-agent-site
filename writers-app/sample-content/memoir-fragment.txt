The summer I turned fourteen, my father taught me to drive in a cemetery. Not because he was morbid, but because it was the only place in town with roads and no traffic. We'd go Sunday mornings, early, before the funeral crowd arrived.

"Okay," he'd say, sliding into the passenger seat of his old Civic. "Remember: gentle on everything. Gentle on the gas, gentle on the brake, gentle on the wheel."

I was not gentle. I jerked and lurched past the headstones like a drunk robot. My father never flinched. He just kept saying "gentle" until I started to understand what he meant.

Years later, I realized he was teaching me more than driving.
