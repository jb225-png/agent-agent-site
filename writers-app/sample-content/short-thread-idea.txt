Thread idea: Why your drafts die

Most writing doesn't fail because it's bad. It fails because you lose momentum between draft 1 and draft 2.

Here's what actually kills drafts:

1. You wait too long to revise
2. You read it cold and hate it
3. You start questioning everything
4. You never open it again

The fix: Revise while it's still warm. Same day if possible. Next day at latest. Don't let it cool.

Your fresh draft is like bread dough. It's still alive. It can still be shaped.

Wait a week and it hardens. You're no longer shaping—you're chiseling. Much harder.

Momentum matters more than quality in early drafts.
