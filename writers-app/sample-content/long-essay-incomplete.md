# The Economics of Attention in Literary Publishing

## Introduction

In 2024, the average literary magazine receives approximately 5,000 submissions per year and publishes 30 pieces. That's a 0.6% acceptance rate—more selective than Harvard. And yet, most of these magazines pay nothing, or nearly nothing, to their contributors.

This essay is about that paradox: how scarcity creates value in prestige but not in payment, and what it means for writers trying to build a sustainable practice.

## The Prestige Economy

Literary magazines operate in what sociologist Pierre Bourdieu called the "economy of symbolic goods"—where cultural capital matters more than financial capital. A publication in The Paris Review doesn't pay your rent, but it might get you an agent. It might get you a book deal. It might get you a teaching job.

This logic makes sense in a winner-take-all market. If you're trying to signal your quality to gatekeepers (agents, editors, tenure committees), you need prestigious publications. The market for prestige is separate from the market for money.

But here's the trap: the prestige market has become so competitive that writers spend years accumulating credits that may never convert to financial stability. You can have fifty publications and still be broke.

## The Submission Grind

[TO BE CONTINUED - this is where I lost momentum. Need to finish sections on:
- The math of submission (time invested vs. acceptance rates)
- Alternative models (Substack, Patreon, direct-to-reader)
- What actually works for writers trying to make money
- Conclusion about choosing your own metrics]

NOTES TO SELF:
- Interview some mid-career writers about their economics
- Get data on Substack earnings vs. traditional publishing
- Research historical comparisons (how did this work in the 1950s?)
