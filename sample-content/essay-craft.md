# On the Craft of Noticing

The best writers aren't necessarily those who observe more—they're those who notice what they observe. There's a difference. Observation is passive. Noticing is active. It's the difference between walking past a tree and stopping to trace the pattern of its bark with your eyes.

I've been thinking about this distinction lately because I've been trying to write more, and I've noticed (there's that word again) that my best work comes not from the days when I force myself to observe everything around me, but from the days when one small thing catches my attention and I can't let it go.

Last Tuesday, I watched a woman at a coffee shop rearrange the sugar packets for seven minutes. Not because they were messy. They were already perfectly aligned. She was making them more perfect, or perhaps just different. I watched her fingers move with the precision of a jeweler, and I thought about all the invisible perfectionism in the world, all the private rituals that no one sees.

That's noticing. That's the thing that turns into a paragraph, then a page, then maybe something worth keeping.

The craft of writing isn't really about words. It's about attention. It's about being willing to stop when something tugs at you, even if you don't know why yet. Especially if you don't know why yet.
