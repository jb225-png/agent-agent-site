**Sarah:** Welcome back to The Leadership Lab. I'm Sarah Mitchell, and today we're diving into something that keeps my clients up at night: retention. Specifically, why your best people—the ones you can't afford to lose—are walking out the door.

Now, before we get into the tactical stuff, I want to share a story. Last month, I was working with a CEO—let's call him David. Fortune 500 company, 12,000 employees, the whole deal. And David calls me, panicked, because his VP of Product just resigned. No warning. No negotiation. Just... gone.

And here's the thing: David thought everything was fine. The VP had just gotten a raise. The company was hitting targets. From the outside, everything looked perfect.

But when I dug in with David, we uncovered something that I see over and over again with high performers. It's not about the money. It's rarely about the money. It's about three things that most leaders completely miss.

**Number one: Challenge.**

Your best people don't want easy. They want hard problems. They want to feel like they're growing, stretching, becoming better. And here's the trap: the better they get at their job, the easier it becomes. Which means if you're not actively giving them new challenges, they're getting bored. And bored A-players start taking recruiter calls.

I had a client tell me once, "I thought I was being kind by not overloading her." No. You were being negligent. She didn't need protection. She needed mountains to climb.

**Number two: Autonomy.**

High performers are allergic to micromanagement. I mean, physically allergic. You can watch the light leave their eyes when you ask for the third status update in a week.

Here's my rule: Hire smart people, tell them the outcome you need, and get out of the way. If you can't do that, you either hired the wrong person or you're the problem. Usually it's the latter.

David's VP? She was running a $40 million product line but needed approval to hire a contractor. Think about that. $40 million in responsibility, zero authority to make a $5,000 decision. That's not a job. That's a prison with good benefits.

**Number three: And this is the big one: Meaning.**

Your A-players need to know that what they're doing matters. Not in some abstract corporate-speak way. I mean really matters. They need to see the connection between their work and actual impact in the world.

And this is where most leaders fail. They assume people know why their work matters. They don't. You have to tell them. Repeatedly. Show them the customer emails. Share the stories. Connect the dots for them.

When was the last time you told your best performer exactly why they matter? Not "good job on the Q3 numbers." I mean really told them: "Here's the specific impact you've had on this company, these customers, this team."

If you can't remember, that's your problem right there.

So here's your homework. And I mean it, write this down:

**One:** Identify your top three performers. Not the ones who are just good—the ones who would devastate you if they left tomorrow.

**Two:** For each one, ask yourself: When did I last give them a problem that scared them a little? A challenge that made them grow?

**Three:** How much autonomy do they actually have? Not on paper—in practice. Can they make real decisions without asking permission?

**Four:** Have I explicitly told them why their work matters? Not implied it. Told them.

If you're honest with yourself, you'll probably find gaps. That's okay. The awareness is step one. But don't let it stay there. Pick up the phone. Schedule the conversation. Have it this week.

Because here's the truth that keeps me up at night: Your best people always have options. Always. The question isn't whether they'll get offers. It's whether they'll take them.

And that decision? That's on you.

Alright, let's take a quick break and then we'll dive into how to actually have these conversations without sounding desperate...
